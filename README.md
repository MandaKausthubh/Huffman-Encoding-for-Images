# Huffman Encoding based Compression

## Overview
DualImage is a C++ toolkit for advanced image processing and compression experiments. It features a DualImage class for parallel manipulation of image pairs, supports BMP, PNG, and WebP formats, and implements custom binary encoding/decoding with Huffman compression and efficient bit-packing.


## Features:
- Provides Image compression mechanism as a ```.bin``` file which closely matches the compression provided by PNG files
- Conversion to multiple image file formats.
- Bit-level compression using bitstreams to minimise file size.
- Custom Binar Encoding.
- Support for BMP, PNG and WebP file types.

## Requirements:

1. C++17 or newer
2. libpng and libwebp 
3. CMake or g++/clang++
4. zlib or zstd
